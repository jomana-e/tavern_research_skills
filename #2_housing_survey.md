# Task 2: Housing Survey

The topline results of the housing survey indicate a broadly receptive environment for policies aimed at increasing local government authority to approve housing projects. While the data reflect strong problem recognition and generally positive attitudes toward new housing supply, they do not directly measure support for the specific policy in question. As a result, the findings point toward potential campaign viability but with notable limitations.

# What do the results suggest about the likely success of a campaign advocating for policies that allow local governments to approve more housing projects?

## For pro-housing projects, we should consider: 

### There is broad recognition that housing is a problem.
- 93% say housing costs are high or way too high (p. 8, Q26). 
- 62% say it’s gotten harder to find housing in the last 3 years (p. 8, Q27). 
- 71% think it is harder for newcomers to find housing now than before (p. 9, Q28). 

This is good news for any campaign: the problem is widely acknowledged.

### People think building more housing would help their communities.
- 54% say new housing in their community would be “good”; 46% say “bad” (p. 8, Q25). 
- On personal financial well-being: more people say improve or stay the same than worsen (p. 9, Q30). 
- On jobs: 67% expect new housing to improve or keep jobs the same (p. 10, Q32). 

This suggests mild but real net support for pro-building messages, especially when framed around affordability or economic wellbeing.

### People believe local governments control development.
49% say local government has the most control over what gets built (the highest level) (p.11, Q36). 

That matters because the question is specifically about policies empowering local governments.
If most people already think locals make these decisions, then messaging about local control may not sound threatening or unfamiliar.

### Nearly everyone sees barriers to construction — including government processes.

- 68% say zoning/building regs are at least a medium barrier (p. 11, Q37).
- 61% say government approval & community input processes are a barrier (p. 12, Q38). 

If people think government processes are slowing things, then a proposal that streamlines approvals or gives more discretion to local boards may resonate.

Overall, the data point toward a favorable environment for pro-housing, pro-local-approval campaigns.

# What ambiguity is there?

## The survey doesn’t directly ask about support for delegating approval power to local governments.
We see attitudes about:
- housing costs
- building more homes
- perceived barriers
- who controls land use

But nowhere does the survey outright ask: “Do you support allowing local governments to approve more housing projects?”
This mean that any prediction requires inference, not direct measurement.

## Support for “more housing in general” isn’t the same as support for a specific policy change.
People might support:
- building more affordable housing
- but oppose dense apartments near them
- or oppose developers
- or resist any new zoning laws even if they support construction in principle

This is classic NIMBY ambiguity: Voters often agree with increasing supply abstractly, but oppose what it looks like in practice - especially if they percieve it as threatening.

## Perceptions of who controls land use do not reveal trust in local government.
Even though people think locals control development, we do not know:
- whether they trust local officials more than state/federal ones
- whether they think locals should have more authority
- or whether people prefer stricter vs looser local regulations

Without directly measuring trust or preferences for greater or lesser local authority, predictions about policy receptiveness remain speculative. 

## The toplines don’t tell us about intensity of opinion.
There’s a difference between support that fades under attack ads, and support that holds up.
We have no information about priorities, tradeoffs, and willingness to accept local tradeoffs (traffic, density, school crowding), so actual campaign success is hard to quantify from this dataset. Expanding the dataset could decrease ambiguity. 

## Potential partisan split is unclear.
The toplines include partisan identification, but we don’t have:
- cross-tabs by party
- differences between homeowners vs renters
- differences by density

These could materially change predictions (e.g., older homeowners might oppose these policies).

# How confident should you be in your predictions, and why?

## Confident about broad sentiment, not confident about specific policy support.

You can be confident in predicting:
- Americans think housing is a problem
- Americans think rules/regulations hinder construction
- Americans think more housing is net beneficial
- Americans think local governments play a key role

But you cannot be confident about:
- support for a specific campaign
- support for increasing local approval powers
- how support would shift in a partisan fight
- who would oppose the policy

All of the identified concerns related to confidence are related to the ambiguities identified above.

Overall, the survey indicates favorable terrain for a campaign promoting local approval authority, but the absence of direct policy testing and key moderating factors means any forecast should be made cautiously.
